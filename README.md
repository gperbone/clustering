## Background
A supermarket chain company aims to enhance its understanding of customer behavior and preferences in order to optimize marketing strategies. The company wishes to segment its client base to better asses marketing possibilities.

## Overiew
In this project, I used a dataset sourced from Kaggle, focusing on customer-related features within a supermarket context. The objective is to employ clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to uncover meaningful customer segments based on their characteristics, shopping habits and preferences. The insights gained will inform the development of tailored marketing initiatives and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset source
The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

## Feedback
Do you have any feedback on how I could improve this project? I would love to hear it, and you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavoperbone/)
